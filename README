Description:
A plugin which creates DVB CI adapters from "stand alone" ca-devices
like the ones from Digital Devices.

Needs the "external-ci" patch for vdr, look at patches directory.
It adds an probe-interface to vdr-core which will allow the creation
and use of external ci-adapters.

The CI devices of the Digital Devices or Linux4Media are not bound to
a dedicated DVB adapter. There will be only a ca- and a sec-device.
The ca-device has to used like every other ca-device, but the packets
to be descrambled have to be written to and read from sec.
